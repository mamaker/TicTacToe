# TicTacToe
This popular Game is written in Python 3.x,
without using the Graphics Packages.
It allows dynamic, interactive choice of Gameboard size.
It also allows players to choose unique initials to markup their moves on the gameboard.
It also allows continuing with a fresh new game after a game is won.
Enjoy!
